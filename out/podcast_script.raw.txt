  },
  {
    "speaker": "Carol",
    "text": "Ah, the Trump-style tactic making waves. Wonder if he'll reply with a tweet or a TikTok dance video."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Jamie",
    "text": "Haha, a TikTok dance-off between politicians? Now that would be a sight! Next headline: 'My son loves football, but Mom's horrified'."

    "speaker": "Carol",
    "text": "Football matches can be rowdy. But hey, at least it's not a full-contact chess tournament, right?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Carol",
    "text": "Optimism in sports, a rare sight. Maybe they'll recruit some rugby-playing leprechauns for good luck."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Jamie",
    "text": "Now that's a team I'd love to watch! Let's transition to a world topic: the new parishioners filling Dublin pews."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Carol",
    "text": "Diverse congregations add a colorful touch to the pews. Maybe they'll start a choir with a global playlist."
  },

    "speaker": "Jamie",
    "text": "What a harmonious image! Thanks for tuning in, folks. Stay curious, stay awesome. Catch you next time!"
